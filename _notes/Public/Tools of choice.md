## Blogging
- [Jekyll Garden](https://github.com/Jekyll-Garden/jekyll-garden.github.io)

## E-mail

## Headphones
- [Massdrop x Sennheiser HD 58X
  Jubilee](https://drop.com/buy/massdrop-x-sennheiser-hd-58x-jubilee-headphones). This
  is probably one of the best headphones under $1,000, with the
  benefit of costing one tenth of that.

- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)

## Password management
- [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/)
