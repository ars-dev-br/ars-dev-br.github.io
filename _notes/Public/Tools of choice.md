Tools that I use and that I actually enjoy using.

- **Blogging**:
  [Jekyll Garden](https://github.com/Jekyll-Garden/jekyll-garden.github.io).
- **E-mail**:
  [ProtonMail](https://proton.me/mail)
- **Headphones**:
  [Massdrop x Sennheiser HD 58X Jubilee](https://drop.com/buy/massdrop-x-sennheiser-hd-58x-jubilee-headphones).
  This is probably one of the best headphones under $1,000,
  with the benefit of costing one tenth of that.
- **Keyboard**:
  [Ergodox EZ](https://ergodox-ez.com/).
- **Note taking and Task management**:
  [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).
- **Password management**:
  [ProtonPass](https://proton.me/pass).
- **Podcasts**:
  [Podurama](https://podurama.com/).
- **RSS reader**:
  [NewsBlur](https://newsblur.com/).
- **Text editor**:
  [Zed](https://zed.dev/).
