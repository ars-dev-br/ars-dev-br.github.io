This is my personal bliki website built on top of [Jekyll
Garden](https://jekyll-garden.github.io/).

Wiki-like notes go to `_notes` and regular blog posts go under
`_posts`.

## Running locally

This is just a regular (but very nice) jekyll theme. You can run it
locally by installing all the dependencies with `bundle
install`. Then, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and open your browser
at http://localhost:4000.
