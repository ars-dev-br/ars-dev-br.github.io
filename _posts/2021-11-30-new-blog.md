title: New blog
---

This my nth attempt of keeping a personal blog.

The chronological sorting of blogs bothers me. It makes sense for
posts that are time-sensitive (for instance, if I'm writing about
something that is happening on the Linux Kernel Mailing List **right
now**), but not when I'm writing about well established concepts
(e.g. high-order functions).

For this later type of posts, I believe the wiki format works
better. The issue with wikis -- with most of them, at least -- is that
they're usually hard to navigate.

This is how I came to the concept of a digital garden and this
particular implementation using [Jekyll
Garden](https://github.com/Jekyll-Garden/jekyll-garden.github.io). This
way, I can have the best of both worlds. Under [Notes](/notes), I have
the long lived posts that will be kept up to date and that will not
lose their value as they get older. And, in [Posts](/posts), I have my
blog posts, texts that made sense at a specific point in time but that
might be out of date now.
